# Karelia-Coding-Competition-2023

Welcome to the repository for the Karelia Coding Competition 2023. This repository details the challenge and my solution that led to a triumphant victory.

## Challenge Overview

The competition's challenge involved working with a scrambled image and a CSV file. The primary task was to rearrange the scrambled image correctly using the clues provided in the CSV file.

### The Task

1. **Scrambled Image**: Initially, we were given a scrambled image, which can be seen here: [Scrambled Image](https://github.com/AnssiIlari/Karelia-Coding-Competition-2023/blob/f88d6fca2091260d1bd13f6793980ca00db919b5/mixed.png).

2. **CSV File Assistance**: The accompanying CSV file served as a guide to unscramble the image correctly.

3. **De-Scrambling the Image**: After rearranging the image based on the CSV file, the image revealed the final instructions, which were crucial for completing the task. The de-scrambled image is available here: [De-Scrambled Image](https://github.com/AnssiIlari/Karelia-Coding-Competition-2023/blob/f88d6fca2091260d1bd13f6793980ca00db919b5/unmixed.png).

4. **Final Hint**: A crucial hint was hidden in the image's metadata, specifically in the alpha line, which was key to solving the puzzle.
